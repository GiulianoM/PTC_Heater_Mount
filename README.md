## Simple PTC Heater bracket.

* Plate laser cut at SendCutSend.com
* Material: 0.125" / 3.175mm 5052 Aluminum or 0.119" / 3.0mm A36/1008 Mild Steel 
* I chose Stainless Steel on my first version, and I did actually tap it with a M4 Spiral Tap with Tap Magic.

* SCS Minimum order is $29, so buy two and share with a friend.
* You can get two plates laser cut, deburred and powder coated for $30.

* Holes for the fans are sized for M4 tapping, you'll need to DIY.
* Alternatively, drill out the holes for the fans and use 4mm Self Tapping Fan Screws.
* Holes for the PTC Heater are sized for M3 3.2mm clearance, no tapping.

* Holes can also be tapped by SCS, but the price goes up a lot. ðŸ˜¬
* Holes on the ends are for 2020 mounting, M3 3.2mm clearance.
* Fits right on top of the bed rails for a 2.4 Voron.
* 5015 Fans so there's 5mm clearance, if you need more room both 5mm and 10mm printed spacers are options.
